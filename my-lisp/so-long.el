;;; Commentary:
;;
;; When the lines in a buffer are so long that performance could suffer to an
;; unacceptable degree, we say "so long" to the buffer's major mode, and invoke
;; something much more basic in its place.
;;
;; Many Emacs modes struggle with buffers which contain excessively long lines.
;; This is commonly on account of 'minified' code (i.e. code that has been
;; compacted into the smallest file size possible, which often entails removing
;; newlines should they not be strictly necessary).  Most programming modes
;; simply aren't optimised (remotely) for this scenario, and so performance can
;; suffer significantly.
;;
;; When such files are detected, we invoke `so-long-mode' in place of the mode
;; that Emacs selected.  This is almost identical to `fundamental-mode', and
;; so provides optimal performance in the buffer.
;;
;; These kinds of files are typically not intended to be edited; so not
;; providing the usual editing mode in such cases will rarely be an issue.
;; However, should the user wish to do so, the original mode may be reinstated
;; easily in any given buffer using `so-long-mode-revert' (the key binding for
;; which is advertised when the mode is entered).

;; Installation
;; ------------
;; (when (require 'so-long nil :noerror)
;;   (so-long-enable))

;; Configuration
;; -------------
;; The variables `so-long-target-modes', `so-long-threshold',
;; `so-long-max-lines', and `so-long-mode-enabled' determine whether this mode
;; will be invoked for a given buffer.  The tests are made after `set-auto-mode'
;; has set the normal major mode.

;; Inhibiting and disabling minor modes
;; ------------------------------------
;; The simple way to disable most minor modes is to add the mode symbol to the
;; `so-long-minor-modes' list.  Several modes are targeted by default.
;;
;; In addition, two custom hooks are available for custom behaviours:
;;
;; `so-long-mode-hook' is the standard major mode hook, which runs between
;; `change-major-mode-after-body-hook' and `after-change-major-mode-hook'.
;;
;; `so-long-hook' runs during `after-change-major-mode-hook'. This is to assist
;; with targeting globalized minor modes, as these are also activated during
;; this hook (however `so-long-hook' always runs after any globalized minor
;; modes have acted, because we call `add-hook' with the APPEND argument, and
;; global modes do not).
;;
;; Between these two hooks it will usually be possible to inhibit or otherwise
;; counter-act any minor mode you wish to disable; but you may need to inspect
;; the code for a given mode (on a case by case basis) to determine the right
;; way to disable it, as not all modes are alike.

;; File-local MODE specifications
;; ------------------------------
;; Ideally we would defer seamlessly to any file-local MODE variable; but at
;; present (Emacs 24.5) -*- mode: MODE; -*- header comments are processed by
;; `set-auto-mode' directly, with the outcome that we never get a chance to
;; inhibit our own mode switch.  Ultimately that specified mode *is* still
;; called (as part of the main `hack-local-variables' evaluation), but our mode
;; switch is *also* called prior to that, which is undesirable (as we display
;; messages at that time).  Once Emacs drops the deprecated feature whereby
;; 'mode:' is also allowed to specify minor-modes (i.e. there can be more than
;; one "mode:"), this problem will be removed, as (hack-local-variables t) will
;; handle file-local modes in all cases.
;;
;; In the interim, it's cleanest to use a Local Variables comment block to
;; specify a mode override, if one is required.

;; Implementation notes
;; --------------------
;; This library advises `hack-local-variables' (in order that we may inhibit our
;; functionality when a file-local mode is set), and `set-auto-mode' (in order
;; to react after Emacs has chosen the major mode for a buffer).

;;; Change Log:
;;
;; 0.6.5 - Inhibit globalized `hl-line-mode' and `whitespace-mode'.
;;       - Set `buffer-read-only' by default.
;; 0.6   - Added `so-long-minor-modes' and `so-long-hook'.
;; 0.5   - Renamed library to "so-long.el".
;;       - Added explicit `so-long-enable' command to activate our advice.
;; 0.4   - Amended/documented behaviour with file-local 'mode' variables.
;; 0.3   - Defer to a file-local 'mode' variable.
;; 0.2   - Initial release to EmacsWiki.
;; 0.1   - Experimental.

(define-derived-mode so-long-mode nil "So long"
  "This mode is used if line lengths exceed `so-long-threshold'.

Many Emacs modes struggle with buffers which contain excessively long lines,
and may consequently cause unacceptable performance issues.

This is commonly on account of 'minified' code (i.e. code has been compacted
into the smallest file size possible, which often entails removing newlines
should they not be strictly necessary). These kinds of files are typically
not intended to be edited, so not providing the usual editing mode in these
cases will rarely be an issue.

When such files are detected, we invoke this mode. This happens after
`set-auto-mode' has set the major mode, should the selected major mode be
a member (or derivative of a member) of `so-long-target-modes'.

After changing modes, any active minor modes listed in `so-long-minor-modes'
are disabled for the current buffer, and finally `so-long-hook' is run.
These two steps occur as part of `after-change-major-mode-hook', so that
active global minor modes are visible.

Some global minor modes may be inhibited by acting in `so-long-mode-hook'.

By default this mode is essentially equivalent to `fundamental-mode', and
exists mainly to provide information to the user as to why the expected mode
was not used.

To revert to the original mode despite any potential performance issues,
type \\[so-long-mode-revert], or else re-invoke it manually."
