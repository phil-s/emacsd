;;; Commentary:
;;
;; `redshift-indent-mode' controls the expansion and contraction of space,
;; based on the `redshift-cosmological-constant' multiplier.  Only the
;; indentation whitespace at the beginning of a line is affected.
;;
;; This simplest way to invoke `redshift-indent-mode' is to call the
;; `redshift-indent' command, optionally with a prefix argument to set
;; the size of the indentation.
;;
;; Local variables can also be utilised to enable this mode. As the purpose
;; is to circumvent the standard appearance of a file, it is unlikely that
;; a file-local variable would be appropriate; but directory-local variables
;; (e.g. using a custom .dir-locals.el file) may prove a convenient way to
;; trigger this behaviour for a given project.
;;
;; There is no differentiation between spaces indicating nesting structure,
;; and spaces used beyond that point for code alignment purposes. (i.e.
;; visual alignments are prone to break with this mode enabled.) You can
;; customize the `redshift-regexp' variable, and/or write a custom function
;; for the `redshift-search-forward' variable, in order to achieve more
;; intelligent behaviour if desired.
;;
;; You may (or may not) find that (setq x-stretch-cursor t) is a useful
;; setting to use with this library, in order to visualise the width of
;; the specified spaces which are replacing the indentation.

;;; Naming scheme:
;;
;; This library is named for astronomical concepts regarding the expansion
;; and/or contraction of Space (i.e. the Universe).
;;
;; Edwin Hubble's observation of redshift in distant galaxies provided the
;; first evidence that the Universe was expanding. Einstein's general theory
;; of relativity had previously predicted that the size of the Universe was
;; variable; however, believing this to be incorrect, he had introduced a
;; "cosmological constant" into his equations to counteract gravity, fixing
;; the size of Space to an invariant value.

;;; Implementation notes:
;;
;; There are two options for changing the apparent size of spaces using the
;; `display' text-property. The first is to use the (space-width FACTOR)
;; specification to adjust the size of each individual space. This is not
;; sufficient for our purposes: Firstly it does not support indentation with
;; tabs; and secondly it works only for actual space characters, which makes
;; the approach incompatible with the likes of `whitespace-mode' (which can
;; use `buffer-display-table' to display spaces as an alternative character
;; which is unaffected by the space-width specification.
;;
;; The second option is to use the (space . PROPS) specification to replace
;; any sequence of chars with a single space wide enough to cover all the
;; original characters). This is the approach used here. Note that in order
;; to preserve the visibility and editability of each indentation character,
;; the text property is applied to each character individually (we could
;; instead generate a single space with a width spanning the entirety of
;; the indentation for that line, but this is less agreeable when editing).

;;; Change Log:
;; 1.0 - Initial release.

;;; Code:

(defcustom redshift-cosmological-constant 0.5
  "The cosmological constant fixes the size of space.

This value is a multiplier, applied to the width of indentation
spaces (and/or tabs) when `redshift-indent-mode' is enabled."

(defvar redshift-regexp "[[:blank:]]+"
  "A regular expression matching a sequence of indentation characters.

The default value matches any sequence of spaces and/or tabs.

If you indent with tabs (exclusively) and align with spaces, you
can set this pattern to \"\\t+\" to prevent redshift from changing
the widths of any spaces following the indentation tabs. This is
most likely to be useful as a file- or directory-local setting.

n.b. Do not anchor this pattern with ^")
