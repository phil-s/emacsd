;;; Commentary:
;;
;; `sql-upcase-mode' converts SQL keywords to upper-case as you type
;; or otherwise insert text in the buffer -- for instance, killing and
;; yanking an entire SQL query would upcase all keywords in that query.
;;
;; It utilises the product-specific regexps defined by sql.el, and thus
;; will upcase only the keywords defined for the buffer's `sql-product'.
;; (Note that `sql-mode' buffers default to the `ansi' product.)
;;
;; You can enable it via `sql-mode-hook' and/or `sql-interactive-mode-hook':
;;
;; (add-hook 'sql-mode-hook 'sql-upcase-mode)
;; (add-hook 'sql-interactive-mode-hook 'sql-upcase-mode)
;;
;; Note that, by default, only lower-case keywords are processed.
;; To handle mixed-case keywords as well, customize `sql-upcase-mixed-case'.


;;; Change Log:
;;
;; 0.2 - Added `sql-upcase-region' and `sql-upcase-buffer' commands
;;     - Rename from sql-upcase-mode.el to sql-upcase.el
;; 0.1 - Initial release to EmacsWiki.
