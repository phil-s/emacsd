;; TODO: Figure out what to submit to FSF for this.

;; TODO: debug-on-entry 'set-auto-mode to see how this is failing to
;; do the expected thing when a mode: local variable is configured.
;; I *think* that when the second round of hack-local-variables is
;; called, we end up processing the mode: specification a second time?
;; Not certain. Needs to be debugged.
;;
;; (edit: I have since modified the advice to hack-local-variables,
;; so the above may no longer be a going concern.)

;; TODO: Define/process alist of mode lists (for derived-mode-p) mapped
;; to behaviours. Include typical support of symbol as callback; otherwise
;; some standard things such as disabling font-lock-mode. Perhaps it
;; should just be a body of forms to evaluate, for maximum flexibility?
;; but then symbol => callback effectively covers that.

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Many Emacs modes struggle with buffers which contain excessively long lines,
;; and may consequently cause unacceptable performance issues.
;;
;; This is commonly on account of 'minified' code (i.e. code has been compacted
;; into the smallest file size possible, which often entails removing newlines
;; should they not be strictly necessary). These kinds of files are typically
;; not intended to be edited, so not providing the usual editing mode in these
;; cases will rarely be an issue.
;;
;; When such files are detected, we invoke `over-long-line-mode'. This mode is
;; almost equivalent to `fundamental-mode', and hence has a minimal affect on
;; performance in the buffer.
;;
;; The variables `over-long-line-mode-target-modes', `over-long-line-threshold',
;; `over-long-line-max-lines', and `over-long-line-mode-inhibited' determine
;; whether this mode will be invoked for a given file.  The tests are made after
;; `set-auto-mode' has set the normal major mode.

;;; Change Log:
;;
;; 0.3 - Defer to a 'mode' local variable.
;; 0.2 - Initial release to EmacsWiki.

most cases, but there are some exceptions to this.")

used, unless it is specified as a local variable.

Many Emacs modes struggle with buffers which contain excessively long lines,
and may consequently cause unacceptable performance issues.

This is commonly on account of 'minified' code (i.e. code has been compacted
into the smallest file size possible, which often entails removing newlines
should they not be strictly necessary). These kinds of files are typically
not intended to be edited, so not providing the usual editing mode in these
cases will rarely be an issue.

When such files are detected, we invoke this mode. This happens after
`set-auto-mode' has set the major mode, should the selected major mode be a
member (or derivative of a member) of `over-long-line-mode-target-modes'.

By default this mode is essentially equivalent to `fundamental-mode', and
exists mainly to provide information to the user as to why the expected mode
was not used.

To revert to the original mode despite any potential performance issues,
type \\[over-long-line-mode-revert].

Alternatively, the normal mode can be manually invoked, or a file-local
`over-long-line-mode-inhibited' may be set non-nil to ensure that
the normal mode is always used for the file in question."
