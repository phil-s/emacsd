;;; Commentary:

;; This library depends on GNU find.

;; This file provides a few methods for quickly finding any file in
;; a given project. Projects are defined in one of four ways.  For
;; the first, third, and fourth described methods, GNU find is used
;; to locate the files within the project.  The second described
;; method uses TAGS files to define the files for a project.  The
;; different methods of defining a project are presented here in the
;; order they will be attempted when `find-file-in-project' is
;; invoked.

;; The first uses the value of the variable `ffip-project-root' when
;; this value is non-nil.

;; The second method of defining a project is to use TAGS files if
;; `ffip-try-tags' is non-nil. It will look for an ancestor directory
;; of the current file containing a TAGS file.  If found it will
;; parse the TAGS file for project file names and will not use GNU
;; find to determine project file names.

;; The third uses `locate-dominating-file'. First, if the
;; `locate-dominating-file' function is bound, it assumes you are using
;; Emacs 23, in which case it will look for a `.dir-locals.el' file in
;; an ancestor directory of the current file. Otherwise it uses the
;;`project-local-variables' library, which looks for a `.emacs-project'
;; file.

;; The fourth method takes advantage of the prominence of version
;; control systems in projects to quickly identify the tree for a
;; project. It does so using `project.el' when available. `project.el'
;; is shipped in this tree, but for reasons of encouraging using
;; default Emacs behavior when and where possible, you will need to
;; manually require it in your Emacs configuration to make use of it.

;; The first, third, and fourth methods use GNU find to find the files
;; withn a project. By default, it looks only for files whose names match
;; `ffip-patterns', but it's understood that that variable will be
;; overridden locally. This can be done either with a mode hook:

;; (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook
;;           (lambda (set (make-local-variable 'ffip-patterns)
;;                        '("*.rb" "*.html" "*.el" "*.js" "*.rhtml"))))

;; or by setting it in your .emacs-project/.dir-settings.el file, in
;; which case it will get set locally.

;; You can also be a bit more specific about what files you want to
;; find. For instance, in a Ruby on Rails project, you may be
;; interested in all .rb files that don't exist in the "vendor"
;; directory. In that case you could locally set `ffip-find-options'
;; to "" from within a hook or your .emacs-project file. The options
;; accepted in that variable are passed directly to the Unix `find'
;; command, so any valid arguments for that program are acceptable.

;; If `ido-mode' is enabled, the menu will use `ido-completing-read'
;; instead of `completing-read'.

;; Recommended binding:
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-M-f") 'find-file-in-project)

;;; TODO:

;; Performance testing with large projects
;; Switch to using a hash table if it's too slow
;; Add compatibility with BSD find (PDI; I can't virtualize OS X)
