* v0.4.0    UNRELEASED

- Compatibility of Transient with various uses of the minibuffer has
  been greatly improved, addressing several edge-cases and making it
  possible to invoke a transient prefix command when the minibuffer
  is active.  7b8a7d71 et al.

- Popup navigation is no longer considered a second-class feature and
  is enabled by default.  Some transients allow arbitrary non-suffixes
  to be invoked, so some key bindings, which were previously used for
  popup navigation, had to be removed, to avoid conflicts.  98d50202 ff

- Each prefix and suffix can now have its own help function.  This is
  configured using the new ~show-help~ slot.  ea5ac99f

- The ~transient-options~ class now supports two types of options that
  can have multiple values: repeated option-value pairs and a final
  option that takes all remaining arguments as value.  #154

- Added support for the use of non-proportional text in the transient
  popup.  7f5520b3

- Imenu was taught about Transient's definition macros.  #178

- It is now possible to return to the parent prefix from a sub-prefix.
  e90f7a16

- Boolean values of the ~transient~ slot of sub-prefixes are now
  interpreted correctly.  4a36b1d9

- Added new option ~transient-hide-during-minibuffer-read~.  5762bd9a

- Added new option ~transient-align-variable-pitch~.  cda6a120

- Added new command ~transient-reset~, which clears the set and saved
  value of the active transient.  51585b8d

- When using Emacs 28, ~execute-extended-command~ can be told to ignore
  transient infix commands.  Even when using that Emacs version, that
  command does not ignore any commands by default, but this behavior
  can be easily be enabled using:

    (setq read-extended-command-predicate
          'command-completion-default-include-p)

- Added new command ~transient-toggle-debug~.  b466cd9a

- Expressions inside the group vectors that are prefixed with a comma
  are now evaluated when the ~transient-define-prefix~ macro is expanded.
  99943f73

- Depend on the Compat package, allowing me to use convenient features
  that were added to Emacs over the last few years, without having to
  wait another few years until everybody has updated to a reasonably
  recent Emacs release.  5ae3c401

- Added basic support for suffixes that span multiple lines (multi-row
  cells).  #193

- Infix arguments can now be invoked following a prefix argument.  To
  use a negative prefix argument use "C--".  "-" cannot be used anymore
  because it conflicts with the most common prefix key used for infix
  arguments.  ed2febd0

* v0.3.7    2021-10-25

- Added an additional safety hatch to prevent Emacs from entering an
  inconsistent state when an unexpected error occurs.  99e48369

- Added support for implementing section movement commands in
  third-party packages.  This was requested by the maintainer of
  Emacspeak.  Because they would be of very limited use to sighted
  users no such commands are added to Transient itself.  769219b5

- ~transient-read-number-{N0,N+,N}~ now support infix arguments that
  have three different states: disabled, enabled without an empty
  value, and enabled with a non-empty value.  626d105e

- If a command is called as a suffix of itself, then the help command
  shows the function definition instead of the man-page as it usually
  does for prefixes.  e17e2b2f

- Give users more control over how the transient buffer is displayed.
  Various aspects that were previously hardcoded can now be changed
  using the ~transient-display-buffer-action~ option.  7c677737

- Added support for adding suffixes that might be neither defined nor
  autoloaded when the prefix is invoked.  This usually results in an
  error and while it is now possible to override that using an extra
  step, it is still discouraged.  6842305e

Bug fixes:

- 1e740608 transient-map: Bind C-u to universal-argument
- e9048100 Explicitly call transient--pre-command in button action
- be119ee4 Export variables for transient non-infix suffixes
- b526b9c7 transient-infix-set: Consider all incompatibility rules
- 7126d6aa Fix hydra-inspired colors
- 0c2255a2 transient-get-value: Add an emergency exit

Also contains various documentation updates and code clean-ups.

* v0.3.6    2021-07-01

- Added new option ~transient-force-single-column~, which may be useful
  for low vision.  #122

- Added new option ~transient-highlight-higher-levels~, which is
  intended for package authors.  90a05622

* v0.3.5    2021-06-16

- Added a kludge to work around some unexpected Emacs behavior.
  ef921d30

- When showing help for a suffix that is also a subprefix, then also
  consider the manpage that is set for the prefix, if any.  a9bdd013

* v0.3.4    2021-05-25

- Very minor changes.

* v0.3.3    2021-05-24

- Added SPDX-License-Identifier library header.  7d3d8d79

* v0.3.2    2021-04-20

- Fixed an error message.  c145229a

* v0.3.1    2021-04-19

- Changed ~transient-prefix~'s ~suffix-description~ slot to be initially
  unbound, as was always intended.  c28b8a4

- Added new functions ~transient-read-file~ and
  ~transient-read-existing-file~.  a3b44224

* v0.3.0    2021-02-21

- Added a temporary kludge to prevent a transient from being invoked
  while the minibuffer is active.  A future release will enable
  this again, once we are sure that cannot cause Emacs to enter an
  inconsistent state, that causes most events to be ignored.  #112

- Improved the backtrace that is shown when a fatal error occured in a
  critical context.  This involved some back and forth.  See commits
  mentioning the "emergency exit".

- Added support for defining a per-prefix fallback suffix description
  function, which is used for suffixes that do not explicitly provide
  a description.  The new ~suffix-description~ slot is used to specify
  that function.  The new ~transient-command-summary-or-name~ function
  is useful, not just as an example.  8b22b52b

- Added ~transient-arg-value~, which can be used to extract the values
  of individual arguments in the output of ~transient-args~.  d76f73f8

- Added support for using variables in group and suffix definitions
  of a prefix.  Such indirect specifications are resolved when the
  transient prefix is being defined.  #101

- No longer bind ~M-<key>~ to any common suffix commands; freeing this
  namespace for a variety of uses in individual transient.  A few
  existing bindings had to be changed because of this.  990eb0a2

- Added ~transient-suffixes~ function, which is useful when
  ~transient-args~ is not sufficient because one needs the suffix
  objects, not just their values.  #98

- Added ~init-value~ slot for infix and prefix objects.  If this value
  bound then it is called with the object as only argument instead of
  the primary ~transient-init-value~ method of the object class.  #96,
  3284f6a0

- Added ~unsavable~ slot for infix objects.  If this is non-nil, then
  the value of the infix is removed from the prefix value before
  saving, setting and adding to history.  #96

- Added support for right padding the keys of all suffixes in a group.
  This is controlled using the new ~pad-keys~ slot of group objects.
  7502390b, 293a437d

- Added support for delaying setup of the suffixes of a prefix until
  that is invoked.  Also added support for using unnamed functions as
  suffix commands.  Taken together these changes make it possible to
  dynamically create the list of suffixed.  See the ~notmuch-transient~
  package for two examples: ~notmuch-search-transient~ and
  ~notmuch-tag-transient~.  f2252d53, a3e53633

- Added the infix class ~transient-lisp-variable~.  2d8ceff4

- Added ~transient-infix-read~, which allows arbitrary commands to read
  a value the same way as would the infix command that is provided as
  an argument to this function.  73694be4

- Added support for coloring suffixes in a Hydra-like fashion.
  To enable this, customize option ~transient-semantic-coloring~.
  248862c5

- Added support for disabling and dimming suffix commands that are
  currently not suitable, instead of completely hidding them.  #80

- Autoload functions that serve a purpose similar to that of
  ~define-key~. #85

- Consistently use ~transient-~ as the prefix of all symbols.
  The old names remain available as obsolete aliases.  dd0c44cb

- Added support for scrolling the transient popup buffer using the
  scroll bar.  #84

- Various bug fixes.
  48238bf5 Allow invoking arbitrary prefixes as non-suffixes
  d85eb790 transient-read-directory: Pass read value through file-local-name

* v0.2.0    2020-02-26

- ~transient-args~ must now be called with a transient prefix command
  as argument.  It is now the only argument and its value must be a
  symbol now, an object is no longer supported.  When this command
  does not match ~current-transient-command~, then this function now
  returns the set, saved or default value.  0312b93, 7d0db28,
  d33fe5a, a6ce195

- No longer use the last history element as initial minibuffer input
  by default.  Added new option ~transient-read-with-initial-input~ to
  allow users to restore the old default. dcf7a4d, 5decc6e

- The set and saved values were not always used.  #68

- Added support for inserting and removing groups.  #36

- Added support for specifying where to insert elements and groups
  using coordinates.  #26

- Added support for moving the cursor inside the transient popup
  buffer using the arrow keys or Isearch, and for invoke suffix
  commands using RET or mouse clicks.  Unlike Magit-Popup, Transient
  doesn't make the transient popup buffer the current buffer.  This
  is important when invoking suffix commands that take the current
  position into account, but it has the drawback that we do not get
  these features for free.  Because I also consider them unnecessary
  I did not implement them initially.  Turns out quite a few users
  strongly disagree.  Set ~transient-enable-popup-navigation~ to ~t~ to
  enable these features.  #42

- Explicitly support Edebug.  Previously when Edebug was triggered
  while a transient was active, then Emacs entered an unrecoverable
  state.  #19

- No longer attempt to display a thin line in termcap frames.  0a96a57

- Work around some Ivy bugs/incompatibilities.  af243d5, fed7ab1

- The new option ~transient-force-fixed-pitch~ allows users to use a
  monospaced font in transient's popup buffer even if they use a
  proportional font for the rest of Emacs.  #25, #67

- Adapted to backward incompatible changes in Emacs 27 that prevented
  faces from extending to the edge of the window as expected.  c1ae1ee

- No longer depend on dash (or any other third-party package).  #66

- When a transient has conflicting key bindings and Transient is
  configure to warn about that, then Emacs entered an unrecoverable
  state instead.  75de1f0

- ~transient-format-value~ now supports options with multiple values.
  #65

- Removing a suffix based on its position was broken.  41cbf49

- In our popup buffers disable the tab feature that Emacs 27
  introduces.  #62

- Inserting a new suffix next to another ended up replacing the latter
  instead if its key binding was defined in the suffix object.  #58

- ~transient-undefined~ learned to make some noise.  #57

- Fix replacing a suffix with another suffix bound to the same key.
  5a360bb, 4ce1868

- Characters are no longer allowed as pseudo suffixes.  To insert a
  an empty cell into a table use the empty string instead.  71687ba

- Added new variable ~transient--buffer-name~.  #45

- Some misconfiguration that affects how the transient popup buffer
  is displayed could lead to Emacs entering an unrecoverable state.
  #34, #44

- The echo area is now cleared when the transient popup buffer is
  shown.  afdf1f0

- If ~transient-show-popup~ is 0 or a negative number, then not even
  a one-line summary is shown initially.  #41

- Added new function ~transient-read-directory~.  a87cb2c

- ~define-transient-command~ now supports specifying the level of a
  suffix using the ~:level~ keyword argument.  6506cfd

- The mode-related suffix predicates now also support a list of modes
  as argument in addition to a single mode as before.  1c6afb8

- The new ~incompatible~ slot of prefix objects makes it possible to
  specify which arguments should be autoatically disabled when the
  user enables certain other arguments.  544b3bb

- ~transient--history-push~ is now defined as generic function.  47b7975

- The a new ~history-key~ slot and ~transient--history-key~ generic
  function for prefix objects.  3668aeb, e627d45

- Disallow setting the level of essential suffixes that are shared
  between all transients.  #29

- The active infix is now highlight while reading its value from the
  user.  #30

- The commands ~transient-set~  and ~transient-save~ can now be configured
  to exit the transient, though by default they still don't.  a47ae94

- Always respect the ~transient~ slot of a suffix, even if that suffix
  has a binding in ~transient-predicate-map~.  919fc66

- Added new generic functions ~transient-set-value~ and
  ~transient-save-value~ intended for prefix commands.  ebe9d9d

- It is no longer possible to set a prefix level to 0, which is an
  invalid value.  #28

- All transient prefix and suffix commands are now automatically
  declared to be for interactive use only.  a6295fa

- Infix arguments are no longer added to ~command-history~ because
  these entries were both useless and extremely noisy.  #23

- ~digit-argument~ no longer exits the transient.  5f0ec7d

- A new keymap, ~transient-base-map~ was added to make it easier to
  change key bindings that are shared between all transients.  This
  new keymap is used as the parent of all the other keymaps that are
  shared between all transients.

- Added new commands ~transient-scroll-up~ and ~transient-scroll-down~,
  which scroll the transient window.  ~C-v~ and ~M-v~ (and ~<next>~ and
  ~<prior>~) are bound to these commands.  These keys were chosen they
  are bound to scrolling commands in the global map too.  This made
  it necessary to find a new binding for ~transient-show~, which ~C-t~ is
  bound to now.  #17

- The new option ~transient-mode-line-format~ allows users to use
  a mode-line for the transient popup buffer instead of just a
  thin line that separates it from the echo area.  When using a
  non-standard value for ~transient-display-buffer-action~ it may
  be necessary to do that.  #17

- The new option ~transient-display-buffer-action~ allows users to
  specify how a window is selected to display the transient popup
  buffer.  The ~lv~ library is no longer used.  #17

- The window that was selected before the transient window was shown
  is no longer re-selected before calling a suffix that exits the
  transient.  If a suffix changes the selected window unintentionally,
  then that is a bug.  This makes it possible to intentionally change
  the window layout using transients.

- An infix is a special kind of suffix.  Depending on context
  "suffixes" means "suffixes (including infixes)" or "non-infix
  suffixes".  This is now mention in a few places where users might
  otherwise get confused.

- Stopped claiming that the transient is shown in the "echo area",
  because technically that is not correct.  Instead talk about the
  "popup buffer".

- Fixed handling of suffix commands that are undefined at the time the
  prefix is invoked.  This is still an error, but the error message
  now explains what is wrong.  a729bbb

- Fixed saving values/history/levels, making sure that the printed
  expression is never abbreviated.  #15

- Fixed jumping to the correct place in a manpage when showing the
  documentation for an infix argument.  c4bf4af

- Bound ~ESC ESC ESC~ to ~transient-quit-all~ because the convention is
  that it should be possible to exit any temporary state using this
  binding.  #12

- Fixed referencing suffix bindings by their key when the key binding
  is defined in the suffix object instead of in the suffix spec.
  e4ffb97

- Remove trailing whitespace from popup text for the benefit of users
  who have set enabled ~show-trailing-whitespace~ globally.  0758efa

- Fixed showing available bindings on a single line instead of using
  the usual popup buffer.  2f011c9, 99d3bf6

- Added a line between the ~lv~ window and the echo area.  ca18bb6

- Fixed adding a new suffix at the end of a group and removing a
  group's last suffix.  #20, #6

- No longer use ~cl-typep~, which appears to have a bug on Emacs 25.
  9183fe1

- Fixed ~lisp~ make target.  170a3fd

- Fixed reading a number as the value of an infix.  8219c0b

- Various bug fixes to
  ~transient--goto-argument-description~ (4f80a89),
  ~transient-show-help~ (ccac95e),
  ~transient-infix-read~ (7bf9759).

* v0.1.0    2019-01-14

- First release.
