PHP Eldoc Plugin
====================

This is php-eldoc, a eldoc-mode plugin for PHP source code.
The hash table is mostly based on Arne Jørgensen's php-extras.

Eldoc-mode is a MinorMode which shows you, in the echo area, the argument list of the function call you are currently writing. Very handy. By NoahFriedman.
