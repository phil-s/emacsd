Magit v2.5.1 Release Notes (draft)
==================================

Updates since v2.5.0
--------------------

Fixes since v2.5.0
------------------

* `magit-insert-unpulled-from-pushremote' and
  `magit-insert-unpushed-to-pushremote' missed an edge case when
  checking whether their section should be inserted into the status
  buffer.

* `magit-clone' did not switch to the cloned repo before trying to
  delete the symbolic-ref "origin/HEAD".

* `magit-merge-preview' did not recognize sections for added or
  deleted files.

* `magit-run-git-with-input' had stopped calling
  `magit-pre-call-git-hook' and logging its git command to the
  magit-process buffer.

* On `windows-nt' systems, having `mount' in `exec-path' caused Magit
  to assume that git is from Cygwin.
